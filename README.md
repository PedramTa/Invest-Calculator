🧠 About the Project
------------------------------------------------------------

The Invest-Calculator project is a lightweight web application designed to help individuals forecast the growth of their investments over time using various input parameters. Users can easily enter their initial investment (principal), choose an annual interest rate, select a compounding frequency (such as yearly or monthly), and define a time period in years or months. The app then calculates the total accumulated value and the total interest earned.

All computations are performed entirely in the frontend, meaning the project does not rely on any backend or server-side processing. This makes it easy to deploy, fast to load, and completely self-contained. The use of Vite as a build tool streamlines development with hot-reload functionality and optimized bundling for production.

The interface is designed to be minimal, intuitive, and responsive—perfect for students, investors, or anyone interested in quickly estimating how their money could grow under different conditions. Developers can also easily extend the project by adding advanced features like graphical charts, inflation or tax adjustments, variable interest rates, or recurring contributions.

As an open-source tool, Invest-Calculator encourages collaboration. Contributors can report issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests. The project’s simplicity makes it a great starting point for anyone looking to learn basic financial calculations, frontend logic, or modern web development practices.
